# Detecting Covid-19 Using Machine Learning 
Technological advancements have a significant impact on various aspects of life, including the medical field and others.
 Artificial intelligence has shown great potential in healthcare by making informed decisions based on data analysis. One of the most important steps in preventing the spread and development of a dangerous disease is early diagnosis. Covid-19 is a highly contagious disease that has become a global epidemic, requiring immediate attention. Due to its fast spread, there is a need for a system that can detect the virus effectively. With the increased use of technology, there is a lot of data about Covid-19 available, which can be used to gain important insights about the virus. In this project, we compared the accuracy of different machine learning algorithms in predicting Covid-19 and used the most accurate one for the final model testing.

In December 2019, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China [1], and was reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on December 31, 2019.
 The virus posed a global threat and was named 'Covid-19' by the WHO on February 11, 2020. The WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency [2] and stated that the virus spreads through the respiratory tract when a healthy person comes into contact with an infected person. Infected individuals may show symptoms between 2 to 14 days. According to the WHO, symptoms of moderate to severe cases include dry cough, fatigue, and fever, while severe cases may also involve shortness of breath, fever, and fatigue. People with underlying conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease are at a higher risk of contracting the virus and may suffer more severe symptoms. Due to the rapid spread of the virus, which has resulted in the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people, there is a need for a detection system. Machine learning classification algorithms, datasets, and machine learning software are essential tools for developing a predictive model for Covid-19.

This project aims to compare different machine learning algorithms, such as K-nearest neighbors, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, based on their accuracy and then use the most accurate algorithm to create a system capable of predicting whether a person has Covid-19 or not, using the data provided.
